# DISE Widgets

**This project is in beta release**. Breaking changes may occur until it hits version 1.

## What are DISE Widgets?

DISE Widgets are nothing more than simple web applications that adhere to a certain protocol. We believe that a DISE Widget has a specific, limited purpose, like showing the weather or when the next appointment is,  and is adaptable to various positions and screen configurations. It is also capable of receiving settings as URL parameters and it understands the three special settings that are _layout_, _tick_ and _verbose_.

If you're using our DISE Widget Core to create your widget (which we highly recommend), most if not all of these concerns will be addressed for you. 


## DISE Widget Core
The DISE Widget Core is a small, opinionated library that is created specifically to act as the foundation of a DISE Widget â€” Hence the name. It does this by promoting certain technologies, offering polyfills if they're note natively available, through a set of tools, and by exposing a simple yet flexible application lifecycle.

We are focused on keeping the DISE Widget Core _simple_. It does not require a backend (though you are free to supply one), it does not require any build tools (though you are free to use one) nor does it require external resources (though you are free to use them).
